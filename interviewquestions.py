# Title: Longest Increasing Subsequence
# Project: geekviewpoint
# Package: algorithms
#
# Statement:
#   Given a sequence of numbers, find a longest increasing subsequence.
#
#  Time Complexity: O(n^2)
#
# Sample Input: [8,1,2,3,0,5]
# Sample Output: [1,2,3,5]
#
# DEFINITION OF SUBSEQUENCE:
#   A sequence is a particular order in which related objects follow
#   each other (e.g. DNA, Fibonacci). A sub-sequence is a sequence
#   obtained by omitting some of the elements of a larger sequence.
#
#   SEQUENCE       SUBSEQUENCE     OMISSION
#   [3,1,2,5,4]     [1,2]            3,5,4
#   [3,1,2,5,4]     [3,1,4]          2,5
#
#   SEQUENCE       NOT SUBSEQUENCE   REASON
#   [3,1,2,5,4]     [4,2,5]           4 should follow 5
#
# STRATEGY:
#   Illustrating by finding a longest increasing subsequence
#   of [8,1,2,3,0,5]:
#
#   - Start by finding all subsequences of size 1: [8],[1],[2],[3],[0],[5];
#     each element is its own increasing subsequence.
#
#   - Since we already have the solutions for the size 1 subsequences,
#     we can use them in solving for the size two subsequences. For
#     instance, we already know that 0 is the smallest element of an
#     increasing subsequence of size 1, i.e. the subsequence [0].
#     Therefore, all we need to get a subsequence of size 2 is add an
#     element greater than 0 to [0]: [0,5]. The other size 2
#     subsequences are: [1,2], [1,3], [1,5], [2,3], [2,5], [3,5].
#
#   - Now we use the size 2 subsequences to get the size 3 subsequences:
#     [1,2,3], [1,2,5], [1,3,5], [2,3,5]
#
#   - Then we use the size 3 subsequences to get the size 4 subsequences:
#     [1,2,3,5]. Since there are no size 5 solutions, we are done.
#
# SUMMARY:
#   Instead of directly solving the big problem, we solved a smaller
#   version and then 'copied and pasted' the solution of the subproblem
#   to find the solution to the big problem. To make the 'copy and paste'
#   part easy, we use a table (i.e. array) to track the subproblems
#   and their solutions. This strategy as a whole is called Dynamic
#   Programming. The tabling part is known as memoization, which means
#   writing memo.
#
#   To recognize whether you can use dynamic programming on a problem,
#   look for the following two traits: optimal substructures and
#   overlapping subproblems.
#
#   Optimal Substructures: the ability to 'copy and paste' the solution
#     of a subproblem plus an additional trivial amount of work so to
#     solve a larger problem. For example, we were able to use [1,2]
#     itself an optimal solution to the problem [8,1,2] to get [1,2,3]
#     as an optimal solution to the problem [8,1,2,3].
#
#   Overlapping Subproblems: Okay. So in our approach the solution grew
#     from left to right: [1] to [1,2] to [1,2,3] etc. But in reality
#     we could have solved the problem using recursion trees so that
#     for example [1,2] could be reached either from [1] or from [2].
#     That wouldn't really be a problem except we would be solving for
#     [1,2] more than once. Anytime a recursive solution would lead to
#     such overlaps, the bet is dynamic programming is the way to go.
#
#          [1]                 [2]
#         / | \               / | \
#        /  |  \             /  |  \
#       /   |   \           /   |   \
#   [1,2] [1,3] [1,5]   [1,2] [2,3] [2,5]
#
# Dynamic Programming = Optimal Substructures + Overlapping Subproblems
# Divide and Conquer = Optimal Substructures - Overlapping Subproblems

#   that some readers will find more intuitive:

#
#      for x in range(len(A)):
#        for y in range(x):
#         if m[y] >= m[x] and A[y] < A[x]:
#           m[x]+=1
#
#      max_value = max(m)
#
#      result = []
#      for i in range(m-1,-1,-1):
